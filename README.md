Immerse
=======

A 3d rendering and game engine library written in C++.  It is expansive - collision detection, software rendering, various file load/parse libraries, and on and on.

I spent a lot of time coding this many years ago while still in high school.  Much more recently, I captured a video of the demo running live - it's available at http://vimeo.com/35163009.

The project compiles and runs in Win XP in the Watcom 11 IDE.  It does *not* work from the (much newer) open source Watcom IDE, so you will have to hunt around to find the original version 11 software.
